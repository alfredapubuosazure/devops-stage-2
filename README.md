Full-Stack FastAPI and React Template
Welcome to the Full-Stack FastAPI and React template repository. This repository provides a demonstration of setting up and running a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a ReactJS frontend using ChakraUI.

Project Structure
The repository is structured into two main directories:

frontend: Contains the ReactJS application.
backend: Contains the FastAPI application and PostgreSQL database integration.
Each directory has its own README file with detailed instructions specific to setting up and running that part of the application.

Getting Started
Backend Setup
Manual Deployment
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the backend directory and install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Database: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Update database connection details in backend/app/core/config.py if necessary.

Apply Migrations: Initialize and upgrade the database schema using Alembic migrations:

bash
Copy code
alembic upgrade head
Run FastAPI Server: Start the development server for FastAPI:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The FastAPI backend will be available at http://localhost:8000.

Docker Deployment
Build Docker Image: Build the Docker image for the backend from the root of the repository:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t fastapi-backend ./backend
Run Docker Container: Launch a Docker container using the built image:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-backend
This will start the FastAPI backend, accessible at http://localhost:8000.

Frontend Setup
Manual Deployment
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the frontend directory and install Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Configure API Endpoint: Update the backend API endpoint in frontend/src/api/config.js to match your backend URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000).

Start React Development Server: Launch the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The React frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Docker Deployment
Build Docker Image: Build the Docker image for the frontend from the root of the repository:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t react-frontend ./frontend
Run Docker Container: Start a Docker container using the built frontend image:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 react-frontend
This will run the React frontend, accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Additional Notes
Environment Variables: Adjust configurations and environment variables as per your deployment needs, especially when deploying for production.

Security Considerations: Implement secure practices such as environment-specific configurations, HTTPS, and authentication mechanisms based on your deployment environment.

Troubleshooting: For any issues during setup or deployment, refer to specific logs from Docker containers (docker logs <container_id>) or development server outputs for detailed error messages.

This README provides detailed steps for deploying and configuring both the backend FastAPI application and the frontend ReactJS application using either manual setup or Docker containers. Customize paths, configurations, and security measures as required for your specific deployment environment.
